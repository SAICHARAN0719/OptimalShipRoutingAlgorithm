# OptimalShipRoutingAlgorithm
This project develops an intelligent ship routing algorithm using A* and ANN to optimize fuel use, safety, and travel time. It adapts to real-time weather and ocean data, avoids land crossings, and supports dynamic rerouting. Deployed via a Flask web app, itâ€™s scalable for real-world maritime navigation.
